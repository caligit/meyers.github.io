			 <h1>Services of Meyers Construction &amp; Consulting</h1>
			 <p>When looking for a roofing contractor in the St. Louis region, you need to think about your needs first 
			 and foremost. Whether it be about cost efficiency, building envelope, or thinking out of the box to figure 
			 out an ongoing problem; You want a contractor that is skilled in what they are doing and can complete the 
			 project as specified.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Preventative maintenance and roof repairs</li>
				<p>
				Different roofing designs require different levels of maintenance. And, 
				if your roof has sustained storm damage, you might need to replace some shingles or 
				patch a leak. The roofing technicians at Meyers Construction and Consulting will be 
				able to evaluate your roofing system’s repair needs whatever they may be.
				</p>
				<li>Roof installation</li>
				<p>
				If the recommended service life of your roofing system is coming to an end—or your home 
				facility has sustained significant storm damage—you probably need to install a new roof. 
				While the roofing material you choose matters, the most important part of installing a new 
				roof is the roofing contractor you use. We prioritize safety, while using proper technique 
				and minimizing your facility or home’s downtime.
				</p>
			</ul>
			<h2>Commercial Roofing</h2>
			 <p>At Meyers Construction and Consulting we specialize in flat roofing and commercial roofing. 
			 Primarily using Thermoplastic membranes that are fabricated from polymers which soften when heated 
			 and harden when cooled. These factory-made sheets are applied on the job site using one of the standard 
			 installation techniques for sheet membrane systems (fully adhered, mechanically attached or ballasted). 
			 This process is repetitive provided the material is not heated above the point at which decomposition 
			 occurs. The membranes can be welded together with heat or solvents, and when welded, develop a bond 
			 strength which equals or surpasses the strength of the base material. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), 
			 blends or alloys of PVC and thermoplastic polyolefins (TPO) are the most common types of thermoplastic 
			 roofing membranes.</p>
			 <p>Determining the best choice for a single ply system depends on several factors, including cost. 
			 However, the decision should not be based on cost alone. Other important considerations are building 
			 height, wind exposure, anticipated roof traffic and aesthetics. In any case, consider the track record 
			 of the manufacturer and the reputation of the roofing contractor.</p>
			 <p>Facility maintenance is often one of a business’s largest investments. When you call Meyers Construction 
			 and Consulting, our commercial representatives will perform a multi-point inspection on your roof to identify 
			 any existing issues or potential problem areas. We will then review our findings with you and answer any 
			 questions you may have.</p>
			 <p>Upon your approval, we will repair or replace your roof. We install the finest products, utilize the proper 
			 installation techniques and will do it right the first time. Meyers Construction and Consulting can offer manufacturer 
			 warranties with many of the roofing system we install. These warranties range from ten to twenty years, depending on 
			 the type of system. These manufacturer NDL (no dollar limit) warranties are only available through certified contractors.</p>
			 <h2>Residential roofing</h2>
			 <p>Your home is one of your most valuable assets—as such, choosing the best materials and having them properly 
			 installed is extremely important. You want a beautiful, effective and durable roofing system and you want it installed 
			 correctly.</p>
			 <p>When you own a home in the Midwest, you must keep your home cool in the Summer and warm in the Winter. Having a 
			 roofing contractor who understands the nuances of residential roofing can be essential to your roof’s success. 
			 Not only in protecting your home from the elements but also for saving you heating & cooling costs year-round.</p>
			 <p>We offer an array of roofing styles, manufacturers, ventilation systems and pricing options. Our sales staff 
			 will meet with you to work through all of the necessary roofing items, ensuring that your biggest investment 
			 is in great hands. All of our residential roof replacements carry a 10-20 year warranty depending on what material 
			 is used.</p>
